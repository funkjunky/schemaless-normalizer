*- research
    *- how to add coverage badges on github readme (code climate)
    *- choose unit testing framework (probably just mocha chai)

*- create repo, proper package.json with version, upload to github, add to code climate

*- create first test (.spec.js)
    *- expandable (easy one)

*- I changed order of args for expandable, so update code. modelName 3rd

*- ensure npm test works as expected

*- fill out index.js with exports of functions from files.

- push and check code climate to see if code coverage did it's thing
    - if not, thenget code coverage working with code climate.

- get coverage to 100% (.spec.js)
    - create definition of correct for flattened data and for expanded data
    - flatten
    - expand model
    - remove model
